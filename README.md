# Mask-R-CNN-for-road-distress-measurement

In this project I trained a Mask R-CNN to do semantic segmentation of distress regions from live video footages of roads.

Unlike my previous project, which only detects, classifies and draws a bounding box around distress regions using R-CNN, this project along with doing all those things also gives the area of distress which will be really helpful for civil engineers and municipal officers to determine the amount of material needed to repair roads and also to estimate the quality index of roads.

The data was collected from an IP camera mounted on top of a running SUV, and the annotations were done by a human.

The below link is a snippet of the code in progress.
